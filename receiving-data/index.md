# Receiving data

Our exchange API can be used to receive data from the PortXchange system. Currently, it is possible
to receive event and notification data. More options will become available in the future. To use
the exchange API, please consult the [API Docs](https://portxchange.github.io/exchange-api-docs/).
Keep in mind that all endpoints require the API key and company ID headers, as described in
[Getting Started](index.md).
