# Receiving data

Exchange API can be used to receive data from the PortXchange system. Currently, it is possible
to receive event and notification data. More options will become available in the future.

To use the Exchange API for receiving data, please consult the [Exchange API Docs](https://portxchange.github.io/exchange-api-docs/).
For examples of receiving PortXchange data via Exchange API, refer to [python implementation example](/resources/event_api.py)
and [command line example](/resources/event_api.sh). Keep in mind that all endpoints require the API key and company ID headers, as described in
[Authorization](/authorization.md) page.
